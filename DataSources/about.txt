This is sample data for the Weblogic datasources plugin.

The my.properties file gets referenced by the plugin. The dev/my.properties will be used if the environment is dev.

As the targets are dependent on the WLS server properties,
I made them all AdminServer at this time so that you should be able to run it with varying WLS properties.
If testing on localhost, change AdminServer to DefaultServer
